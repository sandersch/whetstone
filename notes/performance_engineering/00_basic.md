# Performance Engineering 

## Basic of Performance Engineering

* Maximum use of the compiler/processor/system
* Modifying data structures
* Modifying code structures
* Using the right algorithm

## Bentley's Rules

### There is no "theory" of performance programming

Performance programming is:

* Knowledge of all layers involved
* Experience in knowing when and how performance can be a problem
* Skill in detecting and zooming in on the problems
* A good dose of common sense

### A set of rules

* Patterns that occur regularly
* Mistakes many make
* Possibility of substantial performance impact
* Similar to _Design Patterns_

### Modifying Data

1. Space for Time
2. Time for Space
3. Space and Time

### Modifying Code

1. Loop Rules
2. Logic Rules
3. Procedure Rules
4. Expression Rules
5. Parallelism Rules
